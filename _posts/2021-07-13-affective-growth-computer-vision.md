## Overview

What is the paper about? Why is it important?

#### Problem Statement and Highlights

- Understanding the effect of the exploding CV research on people

- Uses qualitative methods to *discover* the emotional responses to computer vision's explosive growth.

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>**Majority of stories** describe emotions of isolation, anger, apathy and cynicism regarding the growth of discipline and its side effects. (also talk about the increasing competitive nature) (sec 4.2)</summary>

- _from scientists to NN technicians_ — people are stuck in deep learning mode of thought

- *paranoia and fatigue over harmful blackboxes* — uncertainty about social ramifications of the system.

- _selective amnesia_ — effective erasure of classical techniques before deep learning

- *feeling left behind —* conferences less and less conducive to junior researchers; feeling of insecurity about celebrity culture; competitive environment making researchers feel unwelcome

- *marginalizing ethics —* ethics doesn't constitute core topics for a large majority in the field.

<summary>Some new advances are both good and bad</summary>


- *newfound opportunities —* students. have more opportunities than ever, and also disregard for such because of vast number of choices

- *industry reinforcing the DL science —* competitive job market, ill-prepared candidates, frustration over industry funded research problem in academic labs.

## Summary

What is the summary of the paper? What is my takeaway about it?

- increasing development also increased feelings of marginalization.

- divide between pre-DL and DL era. Solutions method perspective.

- recognizing various feelings of marginalization may require rethinking the processes by which decisions can create more equitable relationships and opportunities.
